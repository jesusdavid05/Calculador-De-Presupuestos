            <p>
              Are you wondering how much it would cost to create your app?
               Then you are in the right place! This is a tool
               digital powered by teento that you can use, so
               totally free, for
               <strong>calculate the cost of your application</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is very simple to use. First, click on the button
               of "Calculate cost". Next you will have to answer some
               questions with details of the application you have in mind. In
               total will take you about a minute and as a result you will obtain
               a

            <p>
              However, remember that this result will only be an estimate,
              since there are many factors that will affect the final price of your
              app. For example, it is not the same to create a
              <b>native application</b> than creating a
              <b>cross-platform app</b> or a <b>web app</b>.

               application.👇
            </p>

            <h2>Factors that influence the cost of an app</h2>
            <p>
              Keep all the factors on this list in mind when
               <strong>calculate how much it costs to make an app</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Functionalities</b>: the more complex your app is, the more
                 It will be expensive to develop. For example, if you want to add to your
                 app a messaging system, like a real-time chat
                 with multimedia content, or a record that allows login
                 through email or social networks, you will probably end up leaving
                 more expensive. Therefore, first assess what
                 features are important and which ones can wait for
                 upcoming app reviews.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Quality</b>: an app with many details is an app that
                 It will require more work from the developers.
                 It may be worth it if you want your application to look good,
                 but keep in mind that this will have a cost.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Time</b>: when do you need to have your application ready?
                 Are you going to be flexible with the delivery date? If it is a
                 urgent project that you need to have ready by a date
                 specifically, the price may be higher. How much more

                 project.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Launch Cost</b>: If your app is not a
                internal application and is aimed at the end consumer, you will have to
                make sure he finds it. Upload it to the App Store or
                Google Play Store is not always enough! You will need a
                marketing strategy to give visibility to your app and make
                an ASO campaign. This, of course, has a cost that you must
                consider.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Maintenance cost</b>: even when your application is
                 finished you will still need some technical support. Think that
                 The world of mobile technology is advancing very quickly and you
                 application cannot become outdated. For this reason surely
                 you will need to hire a bag maintenance service
                 hours that will help you adapt your app to new devices,
                 new screen sizes, new hardware… It is also
                 will be responsible for resolving any errors that arise.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Other additional costs</b>: such as, for example, the cost of
                 upload the application to the download marketplaces. For the App
                 iOS Store you will have to pay an annual fee while in the
                 Play Store you will only need to make a single payment for each
                 app you upload.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How much does it cost to create an app depending on the type of development</h2>
            <p>
              When you start talking to a development team, these are
               They will present several options for the design of your app. There are three
               types of development that you should know:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Native application</b>. These apps are developed
                specifically for an operating system, such as iOS, Android or
                Windows. They usually have good performance because they are made to order.
                extent. The downside is that if you want your application
                works on several operating systems you will have to prepare a
                development for each of them. This will increase the budget
                of your application.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Cross-platform application</b>. In this case, the application
                It could be used on any operating system, since the
                code is prepared for it. The disadvantage of this type
                of apps is that they have limited access to hardware (such as
                example the camera or GPS) and are usually a little slower.
                As an advantage, by requiring only one code, development is more
                fast and less expensive.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Web app</b>. This last type of application also works
                 on multiple devices as it loads through a browser
                 from Internet. Because of this it is not necessary to download it. Of the
                 In the same way that happens with cross-platform apps, these
                 Applications may have limited access to the hardware of the
                 device.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each of these three options has its advantages and disadvantages.

               needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if your application is going to be used by many
              users, it is best to create a <b>native app</b>, although its
              cost is a little higher; while if it is going to be used
              for fewer users, as would happen with an internal app for a
              company, you can opt for a <b>multiplatform app</b>.

              How much does it cost to develop an app depending on the operating system
            </h2>
            <p>
              Another decision you must make when developing an app
               to improve your business is what <b>operating system</b> you want
               to be shown.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cost of your app will be different depending on whether it is created
              for <b>iOS, Android or Windows Phone</b>. It will also be very
              different if you decide that your application should be viewed on multiple
              operating systems. If you have not yet made this decision, do not

            </p>
            <p>
              Our recommendation? That you bet on a development that
              <b>adapts to any operating system</b>. Although the expense
              may be a little higher, if you think in the long term you
              It will end up being profitable. This is because it is cheaper to make
              This cross-platform development initially requires
              do them later and separately.

            <p>
              The hourly price of a developer is not the same for
               any operating system. At the moment,

               than this same profile for Android since the average price that
               They charge per hour of work is higher. Furthermore, for anyone
               Of the two cases, the development will be more expensive if you do it at
               through a development company instead of with a freelancer.

            <h2>What is the estimated time to develop an application?</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Developing an application is not a matter of days</b>. As already
               You will have realized with everything we have explained, first
               you must make many decisions (type of development, type of app,
               OS…). When all this is clear, you can move on to
               the design phase and work on mockups and wireframes. These
               Materials will then pass into the hands of the development team. In
               This point will start programming the application, which
               will end when the testing and correction phases are passed.

            </p>
            <p>
              The average development time for an application is

            <h2>Is it a good idea to offer your app for free?</h2>
            <p>
              If you are creating an app for the end consumer (rather than a
               internal app, for example), surely you have stopped to think about its

               do to have more download possibilities. There are others
               ways to monetize your app such as
               <b>through advertisements</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              But if you finally decide to charge for downloading your app,
              Make sure this charge is justified. Make it very clear in the
              description of the market the benefits obtained with that payment
              and make sure you set a fair price.

            <h2>Benefits of making an app for your business</h2>
            <p>
              There are many reasons why you can start making a
               app for your business. These are some:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                An app is the best solution if your clientele needs

                your time answering phone calls, you will save time and
                It will make the job much easier.

              </li>
              <li>
                Another reason is that you need an app to give
                 <b>added value</b> to your users and/or business.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Can an app be the solution to any of my problems?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely yes. Apps have been with us constantly for
               years. In our homes we have at least one device
               intelligent. This makes applications a
               <b>direct communication channel</b> between businesses and clients
               potentials. For this reason you should take advantage of its peak.

            <h2>Options to make an app</h2>
            <p>
              Is the form of development that interests you a little clearer?
              for your application and you know how much it costs to create an app
              approximately? If the answer is yes, perhaps it has arrived
              It's time to get started with the next step:
              <b>get started with your mobile application project</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the internet you will find different
              <b>tools to make apps for free and easy</b>,
              but the problem is that the final result is not at all
              professional —although for a first prototype of your idea it can
              worth it—
            </p>
            <p>
              If you really need a mobile app for your business and get
               profitability of your time and your money,
               <b>the best option is to leave it in the hands of professionals</b>. Tea
               We show three options, but first we will explain the
               different profiles of professionals who work in the creation
               of a mobile application.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have already explained to you how important it is to have the
               best developers for the development of your project,
               but it is by no means the only profile that will be part of the
               Complete development of your application.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, the <b>design team</b> will develop the
              visual appearance of the app before sending it to the team
              development. It will not only be in charge of the graphic aspect of the app.
              In addition, the user interface (<b>UI</b>) and the
              usability (<b>UX</b>) to ensure that everything flows
              correctly in the final version of the mobile application. exist
              great and qualified professionals who are specifically
              specialized in these two areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, when the design is finalized, it will go to the
               next level with the <b>development team</b>. Oneself
               Developer cannot make any type of app! The
               programming languages are very different from each other. So in
               Depending on the type of mobile app you need for your project,
               It is better to find the right developer for this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, as we talked about previously, you must have
              a studied marketing strategy, if your app is B2C, to
              get your potential clients to download the application. In
              At this point you will need a <b>marketing team</b>,
              specialists in ASO, SEM, SEO, campaigns...
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Where are these profiles located?</b> Now you
              We will show three different ones, each of which, just as
              You will check, they will show you different budgets.
            </p>

            <h3>Option 1: Freelance</h3>
            <p>
              This profile may be the ideal option if your project is not
              large scale, on various online platforms you can find
              <b>different freelance professionals</b> who, in addition, will have
              of references from clients who have worked and deposited their
              trust in them.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is possible that an app developed by
              a freelancer, but you can also find many
              disadvantages. On the one hand, there is high competition between
              professionals in this development sector. On the other hand, the
              The budgets they prepare are usually low, so that they are
              attractive, and finally you pay for it with the final quality of your
              mobile application project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another problem that will arise if you need several professionals
               for your project...<b>How do you intend to coordinate them all?</b>
               Are they going to understand each other? Can you take on all the work
               necessary to coordinate them yourself? If you don't have time to
               Don't worry, we have two other options.
            </p>

            <h3>Option 2: App development agency</h3>
            <p>
              App development agencies are specialized in
               technological products like the one you want to create and, therefore,
               <b>they have all the necessary profiles you need</b>.
               This type of agency has a much higher cost than the previous one.
               option, hire a freelancer, but they have some advantages.
            </p>
            <p>
              First of all, you will always be with the
               <b>same supplier</b>. This will give you more time to
               supervise the project completely, it will be comfortable and will allow you
               Be more focused in all phases of the process. Your experience
               is easily validated (ask them for previous apps jobs
               mobile phones they have developed!).
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>high budget</b> presented by these agencies is the
               main drawback and they are not usually very flexible, so
               Any modification you need in your project will not
               It will be economical.
            </p>

            <h3>Option 3: Marketplace</h3>
            <p>
              Marketplaces are a type of website where you can
               find technology services and
               <b>subcontract one or more teams</b> for the preparation
               complete your project without worrying about anything. teento is a good
               marketplace example, this is how it works:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Publish your project</b>, with all the details you need
                 possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Studying your complete needs, deadlines and budget
                 included, we will contact the <b>appropriate team</b> for you and
                 we will connect you with it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once your project is clear and you agree with your team
                assigned, they will send you a <b>financial proposal</b>. Whether
                adapts to your needs, you will start working together! Yes of
                Otherwise an agreement has not been possible, we will request a
                budget to a different team.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The greatest advantage of leaving everything in teento's hands is that
              You won't have to worry about anything. You won't waste time on
